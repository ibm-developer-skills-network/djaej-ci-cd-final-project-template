# Counter Service - CI/CD Final Project

This repository contains a Java Spring Boot implementation of a simple Counter Service for the CI/CD Tools and Practices Final Project.

## Overview

The Counter Service is a RESTful web service that allows clients to create, read, update, and delete counters. Each counter has a name and a value that can be incremented.

## Technologies Used

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.2.0
- Maven
- JUnit 5 for testing
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Tekton for Kubernetes-based CI/CD

## Prerequisites

- JDK 21
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker (for containerization)

## Setup

To set up the development environment, run:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ci-cd-final-project.git
cd ci-cd-final-project

# Build the project
./mvnw clean package
```

## Running the Application

### Using Maven

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Using Java

```bash
java -jar target/counter-service-1.0.0.jar
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t counter-service .

# Run the container
